# The Tools We Use At AmpersandTarski


##Introduction
In the early days of the development of Ampersand, it was a single person's project. Haskell was used as programming language, and the source code was kept on a single PC. Fortunately, things have evolved. Now we have a team, and we use quite a lot of open source tooling to help us along.
The downside is that not everybody in the team knows all there is to know about the tooling. The purpose of this guide is to help out. It will also be a great place to start for new team members. 
Another purpose of this book is to get used to the [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), that is used to write this documentation.

The [up to date version of this book](http://ampersandtarski.gitbooks.io/the-tools-we-use-for-ampersand/) is published automatically every time a commit is done to the master branch. 

## Organization of this book
You will find a chapter for each tool that we use and for which there is something interesting to tell.

## Contributions to the documentation

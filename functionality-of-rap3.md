# RAP3 user manual

These pages are ment to describe the functionality of RAP3. As RAP3 is still under development, some of this functionality is still work in progress. We will tell the current status of everything mentioned here. While doing so, this document will grow until it describes everything one can do with RAP3.

The purpose of RAP3 is to be a platform for people to learn how to work with Ampersand. We distinguage the following ROLEs:

* Student. 
* Tutor. This role is to watch the progress of students, and being able to give guidance.
* AccountMgr. This role is to create accounts and to grant access rights to users.
* GradStudent. This role is for more advanced students.

All of the above users have access to the login page. Further functionality is based on specific roles.

## Logging in

When you log in, a userid and password must be entered. As you leave a field, that field is updated, and rules are checked. You will encounter your first violation of a signal rule:

The last option will take you the 'My Account' page, where you can modify your password. If you do so, you will see that the signal message will disapear, because there is no longer a rule violation for your account. 

## Logging out

Logging out can be done at the login screen, while your session is still active. When you are at that screen, just check the checkbox to logout:

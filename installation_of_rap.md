# Installation of RAP

RAP is a tool that is being used by the Open University of the Netherlands in the course [Rule Based Design](http://portal.ou.nl/web/ontwerpen-met-bedrijfsregels). It lets students analyse Ampersand models, generate functional specifications and make prototypes of information systems. It is the primary tool for students in relation to Ampersand.

We are currently working on a new version, RAP3. We hope to deploy RAP3 on November 1st, 2017. Deployment means to install RAP3 on a web server, to make it work for a group of students. This text explains how. Even though RAP3 is lacking some features, it can already be installed on a server.

# RAP3 user manual - Student

As a student, your main objective with RAP3 is to write Ampersand scripts and have them compiled. RAP3 will help you by giving error messages when your script contains errors. If your script complies to the Ampersand syntax and has no type errors, it will let you generate artifacts from your script. Currently these artifacts are

1. A diagnosis document
2. A functional design document
3. An analisys site, containing an overview of all the concepts, relations and rules in your script. 

You might find it interesting to know that RAP3 has been built with Ampersand itself! It can be regarded as a showcase of what can be done today with Ampersand. The downside may be that not all of the functionality is as smoothe as you might want it to be. There is still a lot of work to be done 8-\)\)

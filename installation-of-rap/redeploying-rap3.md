# Redeploying RAP3

I made a VPN connection to the Open Universiteit, to make it possible to connect through `ssh`.

I entered server `lnx-hrl-202v` using command `ssh sjo@rap.cs.ou.nl`.

Then I went to directory `~\RAP3` to update the docker-compose.yml file using the command:

```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmpersandTarski/RAP/master/docker-compose.yml
```

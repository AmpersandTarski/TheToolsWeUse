## Do's and don'ts


## Every commit in the origin/master branch is built.
If you prefer the web editor, know that each time the master branch is committed, the book is generated. While we are in draft, it is a good idea to use a separate branch to do the writing, for each time you save your work in the editor, a commit is done to the github repo. ([see this info on draft workflow](http://help.gitbook.com/editor/draft.html)) If you use the desktop client, this is far less a problem, because you only synchornize when you made some more changes.


## A reference can only be made to an article.
As far as I know, a reference can only be made to something written down in an article, i.e. a separate file. Therefore, it is a good habit to focus on exactly one thing you want to explain/write about in every file.

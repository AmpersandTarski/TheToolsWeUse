# GitBook

[Gitbook](www.gitbook.com) is a tool to write documentation. The documentation you are reading at this very moment is created using GitBook. It allows to write the documentation in [Markdown](https://www.gitbook.com/book/gitbookio/markdown/details), which is an easy to use document-format.

The documentation is organized as a book. We prefer this over a traditional wiki, because a book contains a content part, which helps both author as well as the reader to think about structure, so everything can easily be found. Each book can be served as a (part of a) website, as well be downloaded in several forms, like pdf or e-book. We use a fully automated toolchain to build the book for each commit to the master branch of a book. 

At AmpersandTarski, we currently have two repositories, each dedicated to the documentation for a specific audience:

1. [AmpersandTarski/TheToolsWeUse](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/TheToolsWeUse) contains the contents of the book

# Tools used in the Ampersand project

## Git

Git is the version control system, which we use to enable collaborative work in the Ampersand project.

## GitHub

GitHub is the repository in which the Ampersand source code is stored.

## Gitbook

Gitbook is the documentation system in which we maintain the documentation of Ampersand and the documentation on how we build and maintain the software.

## RAP

RAP is a **R**epository for **A**mpersand **P**rojects, which is being used in the Ampersand course.

## Appveyor

Appveyor generates executable files for Windows automatically, each time a new release of Ampersand appears.

## Travis

Travis tests every commit in the Ampersand repository on Github automatically. Only the successfully tested commits on the releases branch are released.

## Docker

Docker offers a platform independent execution environment for automated deployment of Ampersand applications.

## Docker hub

Docker hub is the repository in which the images are stored that are used for deploying Ampersand and Applications built with Ampersand.

## Haskell

Haskell is the programming language in which the Ampersand compiler is built and maintained.

## Node.js

## Visual Studio Code

VScode is the preferred editor in the Ampersand project. A VScode extension for Ampersand exists that offers syntax coloring.

## EditPad

EditPad has been used for a long time as editor. A syntax coloring mechanism for Ampersand exists. This editor has been superseded by VScode, because it is being supported by a much larger community.

## ACE

ACE is the editor that is used within RAP. It has been integrated in the RAP-application code.

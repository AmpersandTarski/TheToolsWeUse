# Haskell

## Installation
On a windows machine, installing Haskell is pretty straitforeward:

At the time of writing, I am installing using [MinGHC](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/windows) (The Haskell Platform might work too, but if you want to use Atom  as an IDE, you need MinGHC).

  1. Download [MinGHC installer for GHC 7.10.2 \(64-bit\)](https://github.com/fpco/minghc/releases/download/2015-08-13/minghc-7.10.2-x86_64.exe)
  2. Run the installer
  3. Go to your ampersand location
  4. cabal update
  5. cabal sandbox init
  6. cabal install
  6.

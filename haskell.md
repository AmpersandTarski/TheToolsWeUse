# Haskell

## Installation

[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) comes as part of [Stack](http://haskellstack.org), the build environment of Haskell. 

The [instructions to install Stack](http://haskellstack.org) are pretty clear. Make sure you read the part about the STACK\_ROOT environment variable.

Then, go to the path where you have `ampersand.cabal`. 'stack install' will do the rest.
